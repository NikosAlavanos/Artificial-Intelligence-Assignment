# Reversi (Othello) Game
This project implements the classic Reversi (Othello) game with a graphical and command-line interface. The game includes support for Human vs Human, Human vs AI, AI vs Human, and AI vs AI gameplay. 
It uses various AI algorithms including Minimax and Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning for decision-making.

## Features
- **Game Modes**:
  - Human vs Human
  - Human vs AI
  - AI vs Human
  - AI vs AI
- **AI Algorithms**:
  - Random
  - Hill Climbing
  - Minimax
  - Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** and Command-Line Interface (CLI).
- Adjustable AI Search Depth for Minimax algorithms.
- Visual indication of valid moves.

## How to Run
1. Open a IDE capable of running Java projects.
2. Build and run the project:
   - **GUI Mode**: Run the `Main` class with the `--ui` argument.
   - **CLI Mode**: Run the `Main` class with the `--cmd` argument.
3. Follow the prompts to set up the game.

## Dependencies
- **JDK**: Ensure JDK 17 or higher is installed.
- **Java Swing**: For GUI mode.

## Instructions
- Start the game and configure the mode (Human vs Human, Human vs AI, etc.).
- For AI modes, select the algorithm (Random, Hill Climbing, Minimax, Minimax Pruning) and specify the search depth (if applicable).
- Play the game by following the on-screen instructions.
